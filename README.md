# RaceChrono-Graphs
A simple python script to visualize RaceChrono filmed sessions laps, no matter if they are in the same session or not.

## Use
To run the script you will need at least 2 .csv files obtained through RaceChrono export CSV v3. In fact, for this script to run properly you will have to export a **single lap in each .csv** file, as this script trims the begging and the end of the provided data while exporting a single lap.

I found this program useful as an non premium RaceChrono user that wanted to compare speed graphics of several laps.
